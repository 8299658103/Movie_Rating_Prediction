# Movie_Rating_Prediction
# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction

> **Another day, another project!** This is my first project during my Data Science Internship at **CodSoft** — where I built a machine learning model to predict movie ratings using metadata like genre, budget, runtime, and cast. 🚀

---

## 📌 Overview

Movie ratings influence viewers and platforms alike. This project aims to predict IMDb-style ratings using regression techniques after applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.

## 🧠 STAR Methodology

- **S**ituation: Online ratings impact audience choices.
- **T**ask: Predict accurate movie ratings based on metadata.
- **A**ction: Cleaned data, engineered features, trained ML models.
- **R**esult: Achieved accurate predictions and performance metrics using regression models.
